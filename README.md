# .NET Malware Unpacker (WIP)

.NET Malware Unpacker is a custom launcher that dynamically unpacks .NET malware. This project is still work in progress and should not be used outside of a sandbox due to its dynamic nature (runs malware to unpack it).

Warning: This project is not prouction ready yet

# Methadology

A typical malware evades controls and obfuscates its payload by embedding it in dlls (Assembly).
In .NET to load a dll, Assembly.Load() function is used.
.NET Malware Unpacker launches malware in its application domain, it subscribes to AssemblyLoaded events and saves the
loaded assembly to a file. This design allows both inspecting the payload and the Assemblies that unpacks it.


# Motivation

I wanted to automate malware analysis steps. Unpacking is time consuming process and automating it would save time for
focusing on the payload.
I believe the assemblies in between are also worth investigating to learn how the malware evaded controls. Dumping every assembly is a way to achieve both.
